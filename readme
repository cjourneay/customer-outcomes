The project was a team exercise. The complete report provides the process and outcomes.

Abstract for the project as follows

The challenge for this coursework was to build models to predict three potential customer outcomes
from a sample set of data from the CRM of a large mobile telecom provider. The three customer
outcomes that we need to predict are:

1. Churn – This is the outcome where a customer ceases their relationship with the provider
(i.e.: the customer does not renew their contract and switches to another provider)

2. Appetency – This is the outcome where a customer shows a propensity to buy a product or
service

3. Upselling – This the is outcome where a customer purchases additional services over and
above their current spending (i.e.: newer package, more minutes, more data, etc.)

These outcomes are binary in nature – either a customer churns or does not churn. Our work is
fundamentally a challenge to build models for classification of customers based on the available
dataset.
